				Welcome to One Sleep Company! We are a Pacific Northwest based retail and online mattress
				company selling a quality product at an affordable price. Every mattress in our lineup is
				proudly made in the U.S.A. with only the best materials that you also find in major
				manufactured brands. Our ownership began with two family friends who recognized a major flaw
				in the mattress industry: <span class="font-medium md:font-normal"
					>People are paying way too much money for a quality mattress.</span

						Joe Taylor and Chad Wittig came together with a simple vision: sell quality mattresses
						at an affordable price. Prior to launching One Sleep Company, Chad worked in the
						mattress industry for almost 10 years where he spent time building, designing, and
						selling mattresses for a large manufacturing plant to local and regional retail mattress
						stores. After working his way up from an entry level mattress builder to operations
						manager of the entire plant Chad oversaw the production of thousands of mattresses daily
						being built by more than 100 employees.
					</p>

					<p>
						During this time, Chad realized he wanted to start his own business where he could help
						the consumer get into a quality mattress at nearly half the price of the large retail
						chains. Chad reached out to Joe Taylor, who owns a local HVAC company and explained to
						him the business model with the ambition of teaming up as a partnership and making his
						dream turn into a reality. With over 16 years of experience building a successful
						customer service based business, Joe was the perfect match and with Chad they created
						One Sleep Company. Today, Chad and Joe still live in Pierce County Washington where they
						are both happily married and enjoy raising their children in the beautiful Pacific
						Northwest.
